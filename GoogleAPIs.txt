                              Creating a service account


authentication                the process of determining a client's identity
authorization                 the process of determining what permissions an authenticated client has

authentication                determines who you are
authorization                 determines what you can do
auditing logs                 record what you did

principal                     an entity/identity that can be granted access to a resource

two types of principals

  user accounts               represent a developer, administrator, or any other person 
    (Google Account)            who interacts with Google Cloud
                              intended for scenarios where your application needs 
                                to access resources on behalf of a human user
  
  service accounts            a Google account that is associated with your Google Cloud project
                              represent non-human users
                              intended for scenarios where your application needs to access resources 
                                or perform actions on its own
                              running App Engine apps or interacting with Compute Engine instances
                              can be used as both an application credential or a principal identity
  
    (Cloud IAM)               Cloud Identity and Access Management


application credentials       provide the required information about the caller making a request to an API
                              
  OAuth 2.0                   authentication process determines both the principal and the application
                              used for accessing private data on behalf of an end user

  API keys                    only identify the application, not the principal
                              principal must be authenticated by other means
                              useful for accessing public data anonymously

  service account keys        used to access private data on behalf of a service account 
                                outside Google Cloud environments

authentication flow           choose and use the provided Cloud Client Libraries
                              determine the correct authentication flow for your application
                              find or create the application credentials needed for your application
                              pass the application credentials to the client libraries at application startup time
                                ideally through Application Default Credentials (ADC)
