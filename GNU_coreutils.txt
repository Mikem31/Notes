    3 OUTPUT OF ENTIRE FILES
cat
tac     - cat in reverse
nl      - number lines and write files
        - decomposes its input logical page sections
        header      body    footer)
        '\:\:\:'    '\:\:'  '\:'

od      - write files in octal or other formats
base32
base64
basenc

    4 FORMATTING FILE CONTENTS
fmt
pr      - paginate or columnate files for printing
fild    - wrap input lines to fit a specified width

    5 OUTPUT OF PARTS OF FILES
head
tail
split   - create output files containg consecutive or interleaved sections of input
csplit  - split a file into context-determined pieces

    6 SUMMARIZING FILES
wc      - print newline, word and byte counts
sum     - print checksum and block counts
        - uses 16bit checksum and block size of 1024 bytes
cksum   - print CRC checksum and byte counts
        - preferable to using sum
b2sum   - print or check BLAKE2 digests
        - computes 512-bit checksum
md5sum  - print or check MD5 digests
        - computes 128-bit checksum
        - more reliable than a simple CRC (like cksum) detecting file corruption
        - should not be considered secure against malicious tampering
sha1sum - computes a 160-bit checksum

sha2 utilities  - uses same options as md5sum and sha1sum
    sha2 hashes     - sha224sum, sha256sum, sha384sum, sha512sum

    7 OPERATING ON SORTED FILES
sort    - sort text files
        - sort
        - merge     given files by sorting as a group (faster when it works)
        - check     for sortedness (based on dictionary, I think?)

shuf    - shuffles its input by outputting a random permutation of its input lines

uniq    - prints its input lines so that no output lines are repeated
            or discard lines that are not repeated
            or discard all repeated lines
        - repeated lines are only detected if the are adjacent
            - use sort -u to discard non-adjacent lines

comm    - processes two files and outputs three columns
            lines that are unique to file1
            lines that are unique to file2
            lines that are common to both files
        - options -1, -2, -3 suppress the printing of that column
        - files must be sorted

ptx     - produce permuted indexes
        - reads a text file and produces a permuted index,
            with each keyword in it context

tsort   - performs a topological sort
        - reads its input as pairs of strings, separated by blanks,
            indicating a partial ordering
        - the output is a total ordering that corresponds to the given partial ordering
        - useful for arranging functions so they are defined before they are called

    8 OPERATING ON FIELDS

cut     - output selected parts of a line
        - output is always in the order encountered in the file
    byte-list
    character-list
    field-list

paste   - merge lines of files

join    - join lines on a common field
        - output a line for each pair of input lines that have identical join fileds

    default behavior
        - the join field is the first field in each line
        - input fields separated by blanks
        - output fields are separated by a space
        - each output line consists of the join field, the remaining fields from file1,
            then the remaining fields from file2
