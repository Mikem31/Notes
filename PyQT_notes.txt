You have four main options for designing the UI:

    Write out the code to build the UI manually. This means manually creating each widget
     and laying them out through creating objects in code.

    Build the layout in Qt Designer, save it to a .ui file, then load that from code. 
    Both PyQt5 and PySide2 have functions that allow you to dynamically load a .ui file 
    from disk and build a window from it.

    Build the layout in Qt Designer, save it to a .ui file and translate that .ui file 
    to Python code using a tool like pyuic5 (PyQt5) or pyside2-uic (PySide2). Those tools
     take a .ui file and produce an importable Python file that basically does what you 
     would do manually in option (1).

    Write out the layout in a declarative language called QML and load it dynamically.

create .ui file
convert .ui file to .py
  pyuic5 -x firstgui.ui -o firstgui.py
