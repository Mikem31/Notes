******** OSI MODEL
Open Systems Interconnection model
    - shows how packet traverses through a network in seven different layers

******** TCP/IP MODEL
- uses the TCP/IP protocol suit to specify how data should be gathered,
    addressed, transmitted and routed through a network

data encapsulation  - when a layer protocol adds data to the packet header

Layer name  | application -> transport -> internet   -> data link   -> physical
Data unit   |    packet   ->  segment  -> datagrams  ->  frames
Header info |     data    ->  port #   -> IP address -> MAC address -> interface

application layer   - formats the packet for the appropriate transport protocol
    - HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol)
    - SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol)
    - FTP (file transfer protocol)
    - DNS (domain name system)
    - SMNP (simple network management protocol)
    - SSH (secure shell)

    - packets consist of a header and a payload
        header  - packet's origin and destination info
        payload - the actual data being sent

transport layer     - adds port number of the application to the header
    - encapsulates the application data into transport protocol data units
    - splits the packets into segments and attaches a header to each

    - TCP (transmission control protocol)
        - uses a stream of bytes (serial)
        - uses segments and ports
        - connection-oriented protocol      - reliable
        - SYN segment -> SYN-ACK segment -> ACK segment - three-way handshake
        - headers contain send/receive ports, the order of the segments, and a checksum

    - UDP (user datagram protocol)
        - uses messages and ports
        - connectionless protocol
        - three-way handshake not required  - less reliable
        - headers contain send/receive ports, length of the packet, and a checksum
        - some data loss exchanged for faster data transmission

    - SCTP (stream control transmission protocol)
        - uses a sequence of messages
        - multi-streaming -> several independent streams of chunks (parallel)
        - uses chunks (data chunks and control chunks)
        - used by SSH, WebRTC (web real-time communication)

internet layer      - adds IP addresses to the header
    - converts the segments into datagrams, then determines the IP address to send to
    - IP header includes the IP address of both send & receive hosts, the length
        of the datagram, and the datagram sequence order
    - this info is provided if the datagram has to be fragmented because it exceeds the
        allowable byte size for network packets

    - IP (internet protocol)                   - routes packets from host to host
    - ICMP (internet control message protocol) - error msgs and debug info

data link layer - adds MAC addresses to the header
    - formats the IP datagram into a frame
    - attaches a third header and a footer to "frame" the datagram
    - framer header attaches the source & destination MAC addresses, checksums/CRC,
        and packet separators so the receiver can tell when a packet ends

    - ARP (address resolution protocol)
        - finds the MAC address associated with an IP address
        - used within the same network, otherwise a routing system is used to determine
            the next router that would receive the packet until on the same network
        - first, the ARP look-up table is used
        - otherwise, a broadcast message is sent to all hosts
        - the interface with the IP will respond with an ARP packet containing the
            IP address and the MAC address

    MAC address - media access control
        - unique, never changes
        - OUI - organizationally unique identifier (1st 3 bytes)
    IP address -
    hostname - ties the IP address to human readable name
    - the link layer forwards the frame out through the interface

physical layer
    - receives the frames and converts the IP addresses into hardware addresses
    - sends the frame out over the network media

DHCP (dynamic host configuration protocol)
    - assigns IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways to hosts
  DHCP messages
    DHCP DISCOVER   - host broadcasts to search for DHCP servers
    DHCP OFFER      - servers reply with: lease time, subnet mask, IP address, etc.
    DHCP REQUEST    - host broadcast to let all servers know which offer was accepted
    DHCP ACK        - acknowledgement sent by server

******** SUBNETTING

ifconfig -a     - view IP address

IPv4            - 4 octets (1 octet is equal to 8 bits, which is 1 byte)
IPv6            -

host address
subnet address
broadcast address

CIDR (classless inter-domain routing)
    IP address: 123.12.24.0/24
    32 - 23 = 9 bits
    2^9 = 512 - 2 hosts = 510 available host IP addresses

NAT (network address translation)
    - host1 sends request through the router to host2
    - router opens it's own connection to host2
    - router act as intermediary

******** ROUTING

hop     - each hop is an intermediate device

switching   - RXing, processing, and forwarding data to destination
routing     - process of creating the routing table, to improve switching
flooding    - packet sent to every outgoing link except the one it arrived on

sudo route -n       - view local machine's routing table

local network packet    - ARP
outside of network      - packet needs MAC address of destination
                            - ARP request gets MAC of the default gateway
                            - looks at routing table

convergence - part of the routing table update process
            - when routers in a network agree about the topology

2 primary routing protocols
    distance vector protocols
        - uses hop count to choose route
        - great for small networks

        RIP (routing information protocol)
            - broadcasts table to every router in the network every 30 secs
            - limits its hop count to 15

    link state protocols
        - use shortest path
        - great for large networks
        - more complex
        - fast convergence
        - only sends out updates to neighboring routes

        OSPF (open shortest path first)
            - only updates the routing table if there was a change
            - no hop limit

BGP (border gateway protocol)
    - how the internet runs
    - used to collect and exchange routing info among autonomous systems

******** DNS
- allows access to host using a name instead of an IP address

name server
    authoritative   - hold the actual DNS records
    recursive       - ask other servers until authoritative server is found
                    - can also cache information

    zone file       - how the name server stores info about the domain
                    - or where to get info about a domain
                    - comprised of resource records

resource records    - contain info about hosts, namesevers, etc.
    record name
    TTL             - the time to keep a record before obtaining a new one
    class           - namespace of the record info
                    - most commonly IN is used for internet
    type            - type of info stored
                    - A = address, MX = mail exchanger
    data            - depends on the record type
                    - can contain an IP address if record type A

DNS process
    local host file     - /etc/hosts
    local DNS server    - recursive DNS hosted by the ISP
    root server         - 13 for the internet
                        - mirrored and distributed around the world, really 100's
                        - make referrals to top-level domain DNS servers
    top-level domain    - name server that knows about the particular domain name
    authoritative DNS server    - has the zone file with the resource record for 'www'

/etc/hosts          - contains mapping of hostnames to IP addresses
/etc/resolv.conf    - traditionally used to map DNS servers for effecient lookups

BIND (Berkeley internet name domain)
            - most popular DNS server on the internet
DNSmasq
            - lightweight and easier to configure
            - comes with tools for DHCP and DNS
PowerDNS    - full-featured and similar to BIND
            - reads info from mulitple databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
